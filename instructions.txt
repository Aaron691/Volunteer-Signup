- Copy all the files to the public_html directory on your host gator site (including the secureimage folder).
- You'll want to create a new database in phpmyadmin and run the "event_structure.sql" file to create the tables and columns.
- Create a mysql user with read/write access to just this database.
- Update the settings.php file with the: name of the database, name of the new user, name of the new users password, from email address you want to use for all emails generated by this app (must match your domain name).
- Create a cron job that runs once a day using the event_reminders.php script.  Here's an example command for that:
  php /home/<username>/public_html/event_reminders.php
